# State of Elixir

Official repo for https://stateofelixir.com.

## Project TODOs

- [ ] Research potential questions that might be asked
- [ ] Create a "solid" frontend and cleanup existing view-template relations
- [ ] Create solid and clean deploys (Circle -> Docker -> VPS) that could be reused in future projects (maybe released as a separate tool)
